# RollBall

## Overview

RollBall is a simple demo of LeapMotion, a peripheral that senses hand motions and maps them to input detectable by the computer. The Unity-based game plays much like a traditional labyrinth game in which a ball is encased inside a maze, which must be tilted for the ball to move.

LeapMotion allows us to transcribe the very motion of the player's hand to the that of the game's floor. By holding the hand flat and tilting it as if it were the game's floor itself, the player controls the ball in each level. The compatibility of the LeapMotion peripheral and the Unity game engine make this level of immersion possible.
